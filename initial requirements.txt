Thank you for the clarification! Based on your updated requirements, here’s a revised outline for the *Vendor Mix* project. This version emphasizes the role of supply staff (delivery personnel) and clarifies the overall purpose of the website.

## Project Overview: Vendor Mix

The *Vendor Mix* platform is designed to connect customers with local vendors, allowing them to search for products and either visit the shops in person or request delivery through supply staff (delivery personnel). The goal is to provide a centralized marketplace for local vendors to market their products while offering convenience to customers.

### Key Features

1. *Product Search Functionality*
   - Customers can search for products by name.
   - The system displays a list of local vendors that have the requested item in stock.
   - Each vendor listing includes:
     - Shop name
     - Description
     - Location (with a link to Google Maps)
     - Current stock status

2. *Additional Item Requests*
   - If a product is not found, customers can request it.
   - Requests are sent to supply staff for approval, who will determine if they can deliver the item.

3. *User Roles and Registration*
   The platform supports multiple user roles, each with specific functionalities:

   #### 1. Admin
   - Manages the platform and verifies vendor registrations.
   - Oversees operations and user management.

   #### 2. Deployment Staff
   - Responsible for verifying vendor registrations.
   - Manages logistics but does not need to be listed on the website.

   #### 3. Supply Staff (Delivery Personnel)
   - Delivery personnel can choose to accept or decline delivery requests from customers.
   - They do not need a dedicated login on the website but are registered in the system for coordination purposes.

   #### 4. Vendors
   - Vendors can log in to manage their profiles and inventory.
   - Registration is initiated by deployment staff after verification of business credentials.

   #### 5. Customers
   - Customers can register themselves through an online form.
   - They can search for products and choose to either visit shops or request delivery.

### Technology Stack

- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AngularJS)
- *Backend*: PHP
- *Database*: MySQL (SQL)
- *APIs*: Google Maps API for location services

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Database Design

Create a MySQL database with the following tables:

- *users*
  - id (INT, Primary Key)
  - name (VARCHAR)
  - email (VARCHAR, Unique)
  - password (VARCHAR)
  - role (ENUM: 'admin', 'vendor', 'deployment_staff', 'supply_staff', 'customer')

- *vendors*
  - id (INT, Primary Key)
  - user_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing users.id)
  - shop_name (VARCHAR)
  - description (TEXT)
  - location (VARCHAR)
  - stock (JSON or separate product table)

- *products*
  - id (INT, Primary Key)
  - name (VARCHAR)
  - vendor_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing vendors.id)
  - available_stock (INT)

- *additional_requests*
  - id (INT, Primary Key)
  - customer_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing users.id)
  - product_name (VARCHAR)
  - status (ENUM: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected')
  
- *delivery_requests*
  - id (INT, Primary Key)
  - customer_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing users.id)
  - vendor_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing vendors.id)
  - product_name (VARCHAR)
  - delivery_time (DATETIME)
  - status (ENUM: 'pending', 'accepted', 'completed')

#### 2. Frontend Development

##### HTML Structure

Create the basic structure of your application using HTML. Here’s an example of how you might structure your main pages:

- *index.html*: Main page for product search
- *register.html*: Customer registration page
- *vendor_login.html*: Vendor login page
- *admin_dashboard.html*: Admin dashboard for managing users and requests

##### CSS Styling

Use CSS to style your application. Consider using a framework like Bootstrap for responsive design.

##### AngularJS Components

1. *Product Search Component*
   javascript
   angular.module('vendorMixApp', [])
       .controller('SearchController', function($scope, $http) {
           $scope.searchProducts = function() {
               $http.get('api/search.php?product=' + $scope.productName).then(function(response) {
                   $scope.vendors = response.data;
               });
           };
       });
   

2. *Customer Registration Component*
   javascript
   angular.module('vendorMixApp')
       .controller('RegistrationController', function($scope, $http) {
           $scope.registerCustomer = function() {
               $http.post('api/register.php', $scope.customerData).then(function(response) {
                   alert(response.data.message);
               });
           };
       });
   

3. *Delivery Request Component*
   javascript
   angular.module('vendorMixApp')
       .controller('DeliveryRequestController', function($scope, $http) {
           $scope.requestDelivery = function(vendorId) {
               const requestData = {
                   customerId: $scope.customerId,
                   vendorId: vendorId,
                   productName: $scope.productName,
                   deliveryTime: $scope.deliveryTime,
               };
               $http.post('api/request_delivery.php', requestData).then(function(response) {
                   alert(response.data.message);
               });
           };
       });
   

#### 3. Backend Development with PHP

Create PHP scripts to handle requests from the frontend.

##### Example PHP Scripts

1. *search.php*: Handles product search
   php
   <?php
   include 'db_connection.php'; // Include database connection file
   $product_name = $_GET['product'];
   
   $query = "SELECT * FROM vendors WHERE stock LIKE '%$product_name%'";
   $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
   
   $vendors = [];
   while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
       $vendors[] = $row;
   }
   
   echo json_encode($vendors);
   ?>
   

2. *register.php*: Handles customer registration
   php
   <?php
   include 'db_connection.php';
   
   if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
       $name = $_POST['name'];
       $email = $_POST['email'];
       $password = password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
       
       $query = "INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$password', 'customer')";
       if (mysqli_query($conn, $query)) {
           echo json_encode(['message' => 'Registration successful!']);
       } else {
           echo json_encode(['message' => 'Registration failed!']);
       }
   }
   ?>
   

3. *request_delivery.php*: Handles delivery requests from customers
   php
   <?php
   include 'db_connection.php';
   
   if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
       $customer_id = $_POST['customerId'];
       $vendor_id = $_POST['vendorId'];
       $product_name = $_POST['productName'];
       $delivery_time = $_POST['deliveryTime'];
       
       // Insert delivery request into database
       $query = "INSERT INTO delivery_requests (customer_id, vendor_id, product_name, delivery_time, status) VALUES ('$customer_id', '$vendor_id', '$product_name', '$delivery_time', 'pending')";
       
       if (mysqli_query($conn, $query)) {
           echo json_encode(['message' => 'Delivery request submitted successfully!']);
       } else {
           echo json_encode(['message' => 'Failed to submit delivery request!']);
       }
   }
   ?>
   

#### 4. Google Maps Integration

To show vendor locations on a map:

1. Obtain an API key from Google Cloud Platform.
2. Use the Maps JavaScript API to embed maps on your vendor listings page.

### Conclusion

The revised *Vendor Mix* project focuses on providing a centralized platform for local vendors while allowing customers to easily locate products and choose between visiting shops or requesting delivery through supply staff. By implementing structured user roles and functionalities using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AngularJS), PHP, and MySQL, this project aims to enhance local shopping experiences effectively.
